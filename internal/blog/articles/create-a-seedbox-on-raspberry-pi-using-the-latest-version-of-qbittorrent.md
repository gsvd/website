## Introduction

> A seedbox is a dedicated, high-speed server for downloading and uploading files.
> Most commonly used in the context of torrenting, a seedbox provides many benefits over using a personal computer for the same tasks.

Throughout my experiences with various torrent clients, qBittorrent has consistently stood out for its comprehensive features.
However, as of the time of writing, the only version of qbittorrent-nox available for Raspbian is somewhat outdated (4.1.5).
Compiling from source can be a daunting task, so thankfully, [qbittorrent-nox-static](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static) provides a convenient solution.

## User creation

Let's begin by creating a user specifically for running qBittorrent securely. This step is straightforward:

```
adduser qbittorrent
```

## Download binaries

The following steps can be found in the [qbittorrent-nox-static](https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static) documentation.
Ensure you execute these commands while logged in as the newly created user.

```
mkdir -p ~/bin && source ~/.profile
wget -qO ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox https://github.com/userdocs/qbittorrent-nox-static/releases/latest/download/armv7-qbittorrent-nox
chmod 700 ~/bin/qbittorrent-nox
```

Next, launch qBittorrent to initialize the configuration files, then terminate the process.

```
~/bin/qbittorrent-nox
```

## qBittorrent port configuration

Edit the configuration file by running:

```
nano ~/.config/qBittorrent/qBittorrent.conf
```

You’ll find many settings here, but we’ll focus on the essential ones. Locate the following line and set your desired port:

```
Session\Port=65530
```

## Service creation

Execute the next commands as the root user or with sudo privileges.

```
nano /etc/systemd/system/qbittorrent.service
```

Copy, paste, and modify the content below as needed:

```
[Unit]
Description=qBittorrent-nox service
Documentation=man:qbittorrent-nox(1)
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target nss-lookup.target

[Service]
Type=exec
User=qbittorrent
ExecStart=/home/qbittorrent/bin/qbittorrent-nox

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then, remember to enable, start, and check the service's status:

```
systemctl enable qbittorrent
systemctl start qbittorrent
systemctl status qbittorrent
```

## Firewall (using UFW)

Allow the necessary ports through the firewall, when the Nginx reverse proxy is configured, you can remove port 8080 from your authorisations:

```
ufw allow 8080/tcp comment 'qBittorrent WebUI'
ufw allow 65530/tcp comment 'libTorrent'
```

## Router port redirection

Here's a brief reminder: ensure that your server is configured with a static IP and that port forwarding is functioning correctly.

## Access to web interface

The web interface should now be accessible. Navigate to `http://<your-ip>:8080` in your web browser. The default credentials are `admin/adminadmin`.

Immediately change the default login details:

![qbittorrent-user-access](/static/images/qbittorrent-user-access.png)

## Nginx configuration

We will briefly discuss setting up a virtual host (vhost). Detailed guides on installing Nginx, generating SSL certificates, and DNS configuration are available online, so we won’t cover those here.

However, ensure you've configured HTTPS before exposing your web interface to the internet.

```
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/qbittorrent.conf
```

Copy, paste, and modify the content below as needed:

```
server {
  listen 80 http2;
  listen [::]:80 http2;

  server_name example.com;

  location / {
    proxy_pass              http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Host        $server_name:$server_port;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Host        $http_host;
    proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For         $remote_addr;
  }
}
```

Don't forget to enable this Nginx configuration:

```
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/qbittorrent.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

## Going further

Here are some additional considerations for future exploration:

1. Mounting external storage to save downloaded files. Configure qBittorrent to save to specific directories and move files upon completion.
2. Install [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) to create a personal media center.
3. Setting up a VPN, like [PiVPN](https://www.pivpn.io/), to access your seedbox from anywhere without using Nginx.
4. Securing your server with [fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban).
5. Implementing an [alternative WebUI](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/List-of-known-alternate-WebUIs).
6. Torrenting more safely by setting up proxy usage.

## Conclusion

Setting up a seedbox on a Raspberry Pi with the latest version of qBittorrent can seem like a technical venture,
but it offers a great way to enhance your torrenting experience with added control,
efficiency, and privacy. This guide aimed to provide you with a clear path to getting your own seedbox up and running,
from installing qBittorrent to configuring your system for remote access.

With your new setup, not only can you manage your downloads more effectively,
but you also have a foundation to build upon. Whether you plan to expand your server’s capabilities,
explore media streaming options, or further secure your system, the steps provided here give you a solid start.
Remember, the key to a successful seedbox is not just in its creation but also in its maintenance and security.

I hope this tutorial has been helpful, and I encourage you to share your experiences, ask questions, and provide feedback.
The DIY spirit of the Raspberry Pi community thrives on shared knowledge and collaboration,
so don't hesitate to contribute your own findings.

Happy torrenting!
